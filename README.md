# Overview

This repository contains the C# scripts that are used in my Lego Conquest Unity project. I created this project to get aquainted with using Unity and understand how to impliment its classes into writing C# scripts.

# Development Environment

I created the scripts in Visual Studio and recommend writing Unity scripts in VS as opposed to VS Code. I also used the latest version of Unity to impliment the scripts.

# Useful Websites

- [VS Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

# Future Work

- Modify the Buy, Move, and Attack scripts to be compatible with Unity.
- Add a script to save game data.
- Modify GameMenuManager to toggle different panel objects to active.
